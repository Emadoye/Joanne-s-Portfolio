              I am Joanne Emadoye, based in Germany. I am a Front-end Developer.
              I took baby steps with Shecodes and now I can make use of
              HTML,CSS, JS and every tool Shecode has taught me. I enjoyed the
              journey from day one and was able to learn and follow. The first
              page showcases some of the project I undertook with shecode, you
              can click the button to see my projects. I hope we can talk some
              more by mail, my contact is displayed in the contact page.
